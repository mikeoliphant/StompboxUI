# Troubleshooting

## Installing

Make sure that the ChartPlayer folder is installed where your DAW looks for VST3 plugins. Normally this is "**C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3**".

Also ensure that you have .NET 8.0 installed on your system. You can get it here:

## Stompbox Plugin Doesn't Scan in DAW

If your DAW isn't loading the plugin, first make sure that you had it re-scan plugins after installing .net 8.0

If you are still having trouble, please check for log files here:

"**%appdata%\AudioPlugSharp**"

Error messages here can help track down the problem.
