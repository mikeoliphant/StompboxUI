# What is it?

Stompbox is a guitar amplification and effects application, arranged as a digital version of a guitar pedalboard.

This github repository is the front-end for the software (the core codebase is [here](https://github.com/mikeoliphant/stompbox), to be used either as a remote interface to an actual pedalboard implementation, or as a standalone VST plugin.

This is what it looks like:
